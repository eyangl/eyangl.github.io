Hey there! Welcome to my personal website. I'm really excited to finally get this space up and running. This site will be a mix of personal stories, hobbies, and my passion for technology and AI.

### Why I Created This Website

I wanted a place to share what I'm working on, both professionally and personally. Whether it’s my ongoing research in robotics and AI, or just some thoughts on life and random things like my love for **badminton** or **hiking**, this will be the place to put it all together. Sometimes it’s just cool to have a spot to reflect and document what’s happening.

### What You'll Find Here

- **Tech Stuff**: Updates on my research in robot perception and AI, along with some cool projects I’m working on.
- **Hobbies**: I’m into badminton and hiking, so I might post some things about that when I get the chance to take a break from the tech world.
- **Thoughts**: General musings, random ideas, and maybe even some future plans.

This is just the beginning—more posts to come! Thanks for checking it out, and feel free to drop me a message if anything here sparks your interest.
